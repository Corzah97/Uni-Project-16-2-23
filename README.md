## Description
Today i was tasked with developing my own portfolio

## User Story
AS AN employer

I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples

SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position

## Acceptance Story
GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work

WHEN I load their portfolio

THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them

WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation

THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section

WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work

THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications

WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application

THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others

WHEN I click on the images of the applications

THEN I am taken to that deployed application

WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices

THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport

## Work Completed
Added a descriptive website title

Added links

I included functioning navigation links at the top of the page to take the user to any of the sections

The page was styled for multiple screen sizes, including tablets and mobile phones.

Site is divided into several sections, including About Me, Portfolio, and Contact Info.
